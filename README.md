# Ergopose
This project implements a Pose Estimation tool that uses OpenCV and Mediapipe to estimate human body poses from images and videos. The tool calculates RULA and REBA scores to assess ergonomic safety based on the angles of the human body. It can be used for applications like workplace safety assessments and real-time posture monitoring.

Features
Real-time human pose detection using Mediapipe.
Calculation of RULA and REBA ergonomic scores.
Handles both image inputs.
Technology Stack :
Python
OpenCV
Mediapipe.
